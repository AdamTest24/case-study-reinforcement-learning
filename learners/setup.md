title: Setup
---

## Prerequisites

We assume the core courses have been completed, and also familiarity with Python and virtual environments


## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->

The datasets we will use will be downloaded as part of the notebook.
